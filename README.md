# FOOD APPLICATION

This is a very simple application that uses TastyAPI(https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty) and provides basic functionalities:

* Authentication with devise

* Fetching recipes from the api(allowing to provide a query argument)

* Saving recipes

* Listing saved recipes

* Updating saved recipes

* Deleting saved recipes

Every recipe consists of simple attributes of name and description and also

* Instructions

* Sections - sections is a (not neceserily) named part of the recipe which lists ingredients(named components in the API and database)

# SETUP

* create a `.env.develpment` file with the variable TASTY_API_KEY (similar as in `.env.test`) with the provided key or one generated by yourself through TastyAPI
* `bundle install` - install the gems
* `Rails assets:precompile` - precompile bootstrap files
* `rails dev:cache` - allow caching in development mode (not essential but will speed up some parts of the app)
* `docker-compose up --build` - build images and run the containers (not the app will listen under localhost:3000)
* `docker exec -it food-application-web-1 /bin/bash` - accesss the running container
* `bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate` - create and migrate the database

Application should now be ready to use under `localhost:3000` !

# ADDITONAL INFO

* TastyAPI is not the fastest tool in the shed. thats why I decided to implement query + page based caching in order not to waste time fetching the same resources multiple times . As of now caching has been moved from the controller and implemented inside of the TastyAPI client, open for discussion but reasoning was...
* Thin controllers and models - app was developed having thin controllers and models philosophy in mind. I purposefully put as little logic as possible into these two layers to make classes compact and responsibilities separated 
* User authentication is as simple as possible WITHOUT any password constraints other than default 6 character length in order to make the testing smoother. HOWEVER, creating an account and logging in is required to use the app!
* Layout is a basic one constructed with Bootstrap for the sole purpose of the application looking a little less disgusting
* Pagination - application features two different types of pagination: a) basic kaminari pagination meant to handle recipes saved in the database b) pagination of resources fetched from the TastyAPI to allow users to see more results(TastyAPI does not allow more than 40 results a response)
* App features PostgreSQL database accessible from the docker container
