Black-eyed peas, the glue that holds these empanadas together, have been grown in the Americas since before the 1700’s and have historically been used by farmers (including George Washington) as companion crops. Over the next 100 years, black-eyed peas became significant to African-Americans, and are often associated with good fortune, so they are served on holidays like New Year’s Day in dishes like Hoppin’ John. Drawing on those traditional flavors, these soul-panadas are like a soul food meal, wrapped in a deep- or air-fried crust. They can be assembled ahead of time and frozen for a convenient snack or easy meal anytime!","thumbnail_url":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/408322.jpg","tips_and_ratings_enabled":true,"created_at":1667319980,"draft_status":"published","country":"US","facebook_posts":[],"user_ratings":{"count_positive":7,"score":0.875,"count_negative":1},"tags":[{"id":64491,"display_name":"Snacks","type":"meal","name":"snacks"},{"display_name":"Fusion","type":"cuisine","name":"fusion","id":65410},{"name":"american","id":64444,"display_name":"American","type":"cuisine"},{"type":"cooking_style","name":"deep_fry","id":64493,"display_name":"Deep-Fry"},{"name":"comfort_food","id":64462,"display_name":"Comfort
